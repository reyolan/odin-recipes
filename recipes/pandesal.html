        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A slightly sweet, soft and fluffy white bread roll that tastes amazing with salty cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cups warm milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and yeast in a large bowl; stir until sugar and yeast are fully dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix remaining sugar, flour, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in milk mixture and vegetable oil. Mix until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a flat work surface. Knead until smooth. Shape into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled, at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 4 equal portions using a bench knife. Roll each portion into a log; slice diagonally into 1-inch pieces.</li>
            <li>Pour bread crumbs onto a large plate. Roll each piece of dough in bread crumbs and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let rise until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
